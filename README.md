Country Geek website

Status: Complete with a couple of bugs. Website no longer up.

----------------------------------

Project Overview

Developed for Country Geek, this SvelteKit-based web application aimed to effectively showcase the company's services and facilitate user engagement through a user-friendly contact form. The design focuses on simplicity and ease of access while ensuring a professional online presence.

----------------------------------

Key Features:
- Clean and Simple Hero Section: Designed to capture user attention and convey the core message succinctly.
- Compact Services Section: Lists main services in a grid layout using cards, making information accessible and visually appealing.
- Expandable Service Cards: Each card provides additional details upon expansion, offering in-depth insights into each service.
- Simple Contact Form: Streamlined for ease of use, encouraging user interaction.
- Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across different devices.
- SEO Optimization: Implemented both manual SEO strategies and server-side rendering for enhanced search engine visibility.

----------------------------------

Technologies Used:
- Frontend: SvelteKit with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Backend: Supabase for handling form data.
- Hosting: Cloudflare for reliable and efficient web hosting.

----------------------------------

Bugs and Potential Fixes:
- Form Submission Notification: Currently, there is no notification after a user submits the contact form. This can be addressed by implementing a modal pop-up that confirms the submission.
- Map Display Issue: The map occasionally fails to show the correct location, likely due to Google API settings. Adjusting these settings should resolve this issue.
